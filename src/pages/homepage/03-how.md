There are lots of ways to avoid buying new clothes. Here are a few suggestions...

- You can often pick up bargains at charity shops and thrift stores, including “new”, unsold garments from manufacturers that would otherwise go to landfill.
- Online marketplaces like Ebay and [Depop]() are a great for getting hold of stylish and unique items.
- Facebook groups are great for buying clothing that people no longer have use for, including children’s clothes — and selling your unwanted items too. Plus, finding one in your local area means you don’t have to pay for postage.
