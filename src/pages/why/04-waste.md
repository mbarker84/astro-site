The US is responsible for generating roughly **11 million tons** of textile waste per year, or 82 punds per person. Only a small percentage of clothes are recycled, and many are discarded without being worn. When clothes are discarded they can leak toxic chemicals, dyes and microfibres into soil and groundwater.
